> [!WARNING]
> **Read Carefully !!!**<br>
>
> This is not a recovery image (instead a boot image) and it must be flashed into the /boot partition (since it's a virtual A/B device with no recovery partition). 

### How to Install 
> [!NOTE]
> You must have a backup of the stock boot.img before proceeding !

<ins>**Steps:**</ins>
1. First of all the bootloader needs to be unlocked (since you are here I assume you already have done it)
2. Hold Vol UP + Power Key it open open a menu with 3 options (select Fastboot)
3. Once in fastboot enter the command `fastboot flash boot twrp.img` or `fastboot flash boot ofox.img` (Depending on whether you want TWRP or Orangefox)
<br>**(On this device booting the image directly isn't supported so we have to directly flash it, if anything goes wrong flash back the stock boot.img and report an issue)**
4. Enter `fastboot reboot recovery` to enter into the newly flashed recovery.
5. After your work is done, reboot to System from TWRP.
6. Enjoy :)

That's it! Orangefox should now be successfully installed on your device. It successfully replaced the stock recovery on the device.
Now to access the recovery anytime press Vol UP + Power Key together and toggle the recovery option.
